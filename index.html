          <h2>Why Siebe is our favourite basiest?</h2>
          <h3>Siebe Pogson is perhaps one of the most multi-talented young musicians on the scene. The accompanist/piano teacher/electric bass player/composer grew up classically trained in piano and cello, before exploring rock and jazz in his teens.</h3>
          <p>
            Siebe was born in 1992 and grew up in Putney, Sydney, working as a piano teacher, accompanist, composer/arranger and a bass player. As a multi-instrumentalist, Siebe has been taught by many respected Sydney musicians/composers including Kevin Hunt, Saul Richardson, Gerard Willems and Steve Hunter. He has also studied under bass innovator Victor Wooten and bass pedagogist/educator Anthony Wellington.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siebe began his composing career in 2013 when he started his jazz-funk band Funk Engine. With Funk Engine, he has recorded and released three albums of original compositions the first two under the guidance of world music legend Llew Kiek
          </p>
          <p>
            2014 is a special year for young bass player, band leader and composer, Siebe Pogson. As well as recording his first CD with his jazz-funk outfit, FUNK ENGINE, he graduated from the Sydney Conservatorium with a degree in classical piano studying under Gerard Willems. Although Siebe continues to teach and perform on keyboards for years it’s been the electric bass that was his first musical love. “I tried out for the jazz course at the Conservatorium and did not get in, instead I had 3 great years working on piano and taking jazz courses on the side. When I look back, I kind of had the best of both worlds”, said Siebe.
          </p>
            <p>
              Whilst studying, Siebe met Nish Manjunath, (tenor sax) Holly Conner (Drums) and Felix Lalanne (guitar) who are all jazz students at the “Con”. Funk Engine was born! With the encouragement of his bass guitar teacher, the great Steve Hunter, Siebe also began to write for the new group. “Steve is an amazing bass player”, Siebe commented, “He is also a fantastic composer. He told me I should write music and form a band so I did!”

             <p>
              Funk Engine is rapidly building a following based on its residency at Lazy Bones, Marickville and gigs around Sydney. Their set list revolves around Pogson’s funk and reggae inspired originals but with a smattering of covers. The band’s favourite artists include Sydney jazz fusion outfit, The Subterraneans, Steve Hunter and Japanese funk powerhouses Mountain Mocha Kilimanjaro. Other influences include Bob Marley, Weather Report, Jaco Pastorius, James Brown, Parliament, Bootsy Collins, Herbie Hancock and Thelonious Monk. Monk’s dissonant harmonies and playful melodies are a major contributor to the band’s style of “bent funk.”
